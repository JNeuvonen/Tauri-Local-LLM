# Tauri-Local-LLM

Probably developing this from time to time. Tauri and Rust are cool ways to develop stuff with local LLMs. Desktop applications have easy access to the file system, which, in my opinion, probably makes it worth it to develop on Tauri instead of the web. Some nice people have also made Rust wrappers for `llama.cpp`
